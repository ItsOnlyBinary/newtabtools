          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>This add-on replaces you "new tab" page with what is essentially a clone of the new tab page from Firefox version 30. It also adds functionality for adding, modifying and hiding tiles, as well as a variety of customisations.</p>
          <h3>Releases</h3>
          <p>A new release is <i>usually</i> made about every two weeks. This could be earlier if a bug urgently needs fixing, or later if I'm busy with other things or no new changes are ready for release.</p>
          <p>Released versions can be downloaded from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/new-tab-tools/">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/new-tab-tools/</a></p>
